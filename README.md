# pset0
cs50 Scratch project

# Project requirements:

The project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
The project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
The project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
The project must use at least one sound.
The project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive,
were quite short) but it can be less complex than Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game. As such, 
your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.
